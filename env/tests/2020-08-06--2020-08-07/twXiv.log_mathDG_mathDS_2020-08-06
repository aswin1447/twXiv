text: In this paper we study, for the first time, Julia limiting directions of quasiregular mappings in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of transcendental-type. First, we give conditions under which every direction is a Julia limiting direction. Along the [1/4 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02201v1]

text: way, our methods show that if a quasi-Fatou component contains a sectorial domain, then there is a polynomial bound on the growth in the sector. Second, we give a contribution to the inverse problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of determining [2/4 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02201v1]
